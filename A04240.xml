            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7983:4"/>it conuenient that yee ſhould in our name acquaint the Houſe with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere truth of our meaning in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the end that they being at a point in that queſtion, may with the greater expedition conclude ſuch ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall things as are neceſſarie to bee done before the ending of this ſo longſome Seſsion of Parliament.</p>
            <p>It is true that euer before and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpace after the ſitting downe of this Parliament, we were conſtantlie reſolued neither to thinke, nor in caſe it had been offred vnto vs, any waies to haue accepted a Subſidie at this time: For as in our firſt ſpeech to this whole Parliament, wee declared how vnwilling wee ſhould euer be to be a burden to our people; ſo thought we it an vnfit time, at our firſt Parliament, after our ſo happie and peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie in this kingdom with ſo great and general an applauſe, for hauing a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie raiſed vpon them, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7983:4"/>of our preſent great neceſsitie, and that thorough the occaſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers great expences, whereunto wee were driuen at our firſt entrie here. But after the aſſembling of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee were ſo often dealt with and informed by diuers members of that Houſe, that were otherwiſe ſtrangers to our affaires, that it was a thing both honourable and reaſonable, that a Subſidie ſhould bee granted vnto vs; that both our neceſsity required it, and the people in their loue were readie to offer it vnto vs; That it was euer the forme of all Kings of England to haue a Subſidie giuen them at the very firſt aſſembling of their firſt Parliament: That as it was honourable for vs to receiue it, (being an earneſt penie of the peoples loue toward vs) ſo would it be a thing nothing preiudiciall nor hurtfull for them to yeeld vnto; and that there was enow in that Houſe that were ſtriuing amongſt themſelues,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7983:5"/>who ſhould bee the firſt propounder thereof, as at the laſt we were mooued to bee contented that ſome ſhould prooue the Houſes minde in it. Onely in this point were wee carefull that in caſe it were propounded and put to a queſtion, it ſhould receiue no publike refuſall, which could not but be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable vnto vs, eſpecially in the ſight of all the ſtrangers that are now here. But hauing now with time more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly examined both the cuſtome in the like caſes at the firſt Parliaments of our predeceſſors here; as likewiſe that the laſt Termes payment of the old great Subſidie is not yet come; ſo as a double burden ſhall appeare to be laid vpon the people, and yet our commoditie neuer a haire the neerer: We haue hereupon concluded with our ſelfe to reſort to our former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and therefore is it our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe will that yee ſhall in our name ſignifie to our ſaid Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
